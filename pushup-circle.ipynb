At time $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ each friend does one pushup if exactly one of their immediate neighbors did a pushup at time $t - 1$. Otherwise, they do not do any pushups. Let $C_n(t)$ be the number of pushups done at time $t$, and let $P(n) = \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty C_n(t)$ be the total number of pushups (possibly infinity) done with a group of $n$ friends.\n",
